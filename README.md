## Syntax and Formatting

One of the simplest forms of a styleguide is a set of rules regarding syntax and formatting. Having a standard way of writing code means that code will always look and feel familiar to all members of the team.

* Use `4` spaces indents - use spaces over tabs because tabs aren't always displayed the same size on all devices;
* Never mix spaces with tabs;
* Use 80 character wide columns;
* Meaningful use of whitespace helps reading code much faster;
* Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding;
* Delete trailing whitespace;
* Each file ends with a blank newline.
