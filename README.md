# bitVice Style Guide for JavaScript

The general JavaScript coding styles that I use in my code.
If you find this useful, I encourage you to [fork it](https://github.com/bitvice/JS-StyleGuide) and use it for your own team's guide.

## Table of contents

* [Editor] (#editor)
* 

## Editor

This is how I configure my editor.

#### Indentation

* Use soft tabs with `4` spaces. Use spaces over tabs because tabs aren't always displayed the same size on all devices.
* Never mix spaces with tabs.

#### Encoding

Use `UTF-8` as the source file encoding.

#### Whitespace

* Delete trailing whitespace.
* End each file ends with a blank newline.
